# TwoSense
TwoSense - As we get older our ability to hear high pitched sounds decreases. 
The younger you are the higher the frequency you can hear. 
TwoSense is a web application that rates your hearing and tells you your hearing age. 
It also tests your eyesight for colorblindness by providing simple visual tests.
